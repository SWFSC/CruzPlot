CruzPlot is an R package that contains a GUI for creating maps, plotting data, and performing basic data summaries from data files in the “DAS” format (typically produced by the SWFSC software WinCruz).

## Installation

You can install the released version of CruzPlot from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("CruzPlot")
```

You can install the developmental version of CruzPlot from [GitHub](https://github.com/). To use the development version of CruzPlot, it is recommended to install the development version of [swfscDAS](https://swfsc.github.io/swfscDAS/index.html) as well:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # Install remotes package if needed
remotes::install_github("swfsc/swfscDAS", build_vignettes = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("swfsc/CruzPlot")
```

After updating CruzPlot, it is recommended to create and save new workspaces, rather than using workspaces saved with a previous version of CruzPlot. Please contact the developer if you have any issues.

## Running CruzPlot

To open and run CruzPlot, run the following code in RStudio:

``` r
CruzPlot::cruzplot_gui()
```

If text or images overlap within the CruzPlot window, you can make the browser window full screen or adjust the text size in your browser (e.g., Ctrl - minus (‘-’) on Windows systems)

## CruzPlot manual

The CruzPlot manual can be downloaded [at this link](https://github.com/swfsc/CruzPlot/blob/master/inst/shiny/www/CruzPlot_Manual_app.pdf), or accessed when running CruzPlot by opening the “CruzPlot Manual” page. It is recommended for new users to read the first two pages of the manual for orientation purposes; the rest of the manual contains section-specific information (formatting requirements, etc.) and can be read on an as-needed basis.
